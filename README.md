##MVP

This app allows users to store their record collection and to keep track of their favorite albums, artists, and songs. Basic features include:

* User login
* Views
  - List of all albums
  - Individual albums with song list
  - List of all artists
  - List of all songs
* Favorites (albums, artists, songs)

During this project, I moved the AJAX calls and search function beyond the definition of the MVP. These would be the features I would work on next, if given more time. For now, I just wanted to make sure that the CRUD functions worked properly for artists, albums, and songs. All controllers, models, and views have been set up to accommodate these things. Next steps would be to set up AJAX calls for favoriting and un-favoriting artists, albums, and songs, and setting up a search function for users to find things in their collections by name or title.
